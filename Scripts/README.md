# NetTools

## Description...again
Added this README to this directory as well so you wont have to flip back and forth in the repo. This is a collection of network tools I've built over time. Many of these are old scripts that I blew some dust off and rebuilt. Before you ask, yes, I used an AI coding assistant to clean up the code and make my fancy menus and stuff. However, most of these I coded the base code without AI. Actually all of these I did, but then I figured I'd clean things up since I'm gonna actually share them with others to use.

## Installation
Each package is different and requires different libraries. I highly advice you use a virtual environment.

### Fire up virtual environment

Mac / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Windows:

Does python even run on windows?

## Scripts Usage!
Use these scripts at your own risk! Also, make sure you have permission to 'scan' or 'test' things before you actually do it. Nothing here will do or cause harm in the current state.

## Tools and What They Do!
Here is a quick tidbit about each tool and what it does.

### ✅ Scripts > Scannery.py
This tool leverages nmap on your host machine and gives you a menu of different fingerprinting/scanning options.

### ✅ Scripts > Zscaler_test.py
This nifty little script will simply help you determine if your host machine is behind a Zscaler proxy. Good for troubleshooting.

### ✅ Scripts > Network_monitor.py
Very simple monitor for your host machine's network interfaces. This is a LIVE monitor and will run until you cancel with CTRL-C.

### ✅ Scripts > Sysinfo.py
Im not gonna even lie on this one, this is all AI. I didnt code ANYTHING on this. This will extract all of the host network connection information.

### ✅ Scripts > Lottery.py
Just because I like sharing my random scripts, this one is one I wrote a couple years ago for grins (when i was learning python) that generates and analyzes lottery number picks. Do not waste your money on the lottery, this isnt magic, its just random number generator. I used AI to update the output and display of this.

## Support
Sorry, no support! Use at your own risk! Just kidding, feel free to reach out if you have questions or need help.

If you are somewhat new to using scripts and/or python just remember that CTRL-C or CTRL-Z usually stops the script from running.
