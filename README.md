# NetTools

## Description
This is a collection of network tools I've built over time. Many of these are old scripts that I blew some dust off and rebuilt. Before you ask, yes, I used an AI coding assistant to clean up the code and make my fancy menus and stuff. However, most of these I coded the base code without AI. Actually all of these I did, but then I figured I'd clean things up since I'm gonna actually share them with others to use.

## Installation
Each package is different and requires different libraries. I highly advice you use a virtual environment.

### Fire up virtual environment

Mac / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Windows:

Does python even run on windows?

## Usage
There are 2 subdirectories here. Packages and Scripts. The packages directory has more complex multi-file programs (multi function or advanced functionality), and the scripts directory which has mostly single function or single purpose (and single file) scripts.

## Tools and What They Do!
Here is a quick tidbit about each tool and what it does.

### ✅ Scripts > Scannery.py
This tool leverages nmap on your host machine and gives you a menu of different fingerprinting/scanning options.

### ✅ Scripts > Zscaler_test.py
This nifty little script will simply help you determine if your host machine is behind a Zscaler proxy. Good for troubleshooting.

### ✅ Scripts > Network_monitor.py
Very simple monitor for your host machine's network interfaces. This is a LIVE monitor and will run until you cancel with CTRL-C.

## Support
Sorry, no support! Use at your own risk! Just kidding, feel free to reach out if you have questions or need help.

If you are somewhat new to using scripts and/or python just remember that CTRL-C or CTRL-Z usually stops the script from running.

## Contributing
You are welcome to give me money, gifts, tips, or solid life advice. If you have a feature or want to actually fork/improve one of these thats awesome too.
