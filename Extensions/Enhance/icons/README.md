# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, if needed)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tool. For internal use, a simple colored square with the letter "E" or "Enhance" text is sufficient.

### Quick Creation Options

1. **Online Tools**:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/

2. **Image Editor**:
   - Create a square image with your desired design
   - Export as PNG at the required sizes

3. **Placeholder**:
   - For testing, you can use any PNG files renamed to the above names
   - The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use a distinct color (e.g., blue #007bff) to match the extension theme
- Include "E" or "Enhance" text for clarity
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
